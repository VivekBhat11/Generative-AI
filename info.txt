 Skill India Q\&A Flow Explanation

1. **Skill India Document is Loaded**

* Your program first **loads the Skill India text file** (like `skill_india.txt`).
* This file contains all the important information about the Skill India program.

2. **Document is Split into Small Pieces**

* The loaded document is **split into smaller chunks** (for example, pieces of 500 characters).
* This makes it easier for the program to search and retrieve relevant parts quickly.

3. **Create Embeddings (Vector Representation)**

* Each chunk is converted into a **vector embedding** using Cohere’s embedding model.
* Embeddings are like a mathematical summary of the text, capturing the meaning of each chunk.

4. **Store Embeddings in a Vector Database (FAISS)**

* These embeddings are saved into a **FAISS vector store**, which allows fast searching of relevant chunks.

5. **User Asks a Question About Skill India**

* You enter a question like:
  *“What are the objectives of Skill India?”*

6. **Retrieve Relevant Chunks Based on Question**

* Your program converts the question into an embedding too.
* It searches the vector store to **find the chunks most related** to your question.

7. **Pass Retrieved Chunks + Question to Language Model**

* The program sends the question **along with the most relevant text chunks** to the Cohere language model.
* This gives the model context to generate an accurate answer.

8. **Get Answer and Display to User**

* Cohere generates a natural language answer based on the input.
* Your program shows this answer on the screen as a response to your question.

### Summary:

* Load Skill India text → split and embed chunks → store embeddings →
* User asks question → convert question to embedding → search for relevant chunks →
* Send chunks + question to Cohere → get answer → display answer

### Institution Info Fetching Flow Explanation

1. **User Inputs Institution Name**

* The user types in the name of an institution, for example:
  *“Indian Institute of Technology”*

2. **Fetch Wikipedia Content**

* Your program uses the **Wikipedia API** to get the content (text) of the institution’s Wikipedia page.
* It grabs a limited portion of the content (like the first 2000 characters) to keep things concise.

3. **Define the Desired Output Schema Using Pydantic**

* You define a **template (schema)** of the details you want to extract, such as:

  * Founder
  * Founded Year
  * Current Branches
  * Number of Employees
  * A brief 4-line summary

4. **Create a Prompt Template for the Language Model**

* The program creates a **prompt template** combining:

  * The fetched Wikipedia content
  * The instructions about the output format (from Pydantic)
  * The institution name

5. **Send the Prompt to the Language Model (Cohere)**

* The prompt with the Wikipedia content and instructions is passed to Cohere’s language model.
* The model reads the content and extracts the requested information in the structured format you defined.

6. **Parse the Model Output Using Pydantic**

* The model’s response is parsed by Pydantic into a neat data object with fields like founder, founded, branches, etc.
* This ensures the output is clean, structured, and easy to display.

7. **Display the Extracted Institution Details**

* Your program then shows these details clearly on the screen for the user.

### Summary:

* User inputs institution name → fetch Wikipedia page content →
* Define what info to extract (founder, branches, etc.) → prepare prompt →
* Send prompt + content to Cohere → parse response into structured data →
* Show institution info to user

### Indian Penal Code Chatbot Flow Explanation

1. **Load the IPC Document**  
- Your program loads the full text of the Indian Penal Code saved in a file (like `ipc.txt`).  
- This text is usually very long, so it needs to be handled carefully.

2. **Split the Document into Smaller Pieces**  
- The big IPC text is split into smaller chunks (for example, 500 characters each) to make it easier for the AI model to process.  
- This splitting helps the chatbot quickly find relevant parts to answer user questions.

3. **Create Embeddings for Each Chunk**  
- Each chunk is converted into a mathematical representation called an **embedding** using the Cohere API.  
- These embeddings help the system understand the meaning of each chunk.

4. **Build a Vector Store to Search Chunks**  
- All the chunk embeddings are stored in a **vector database** (like FAISS).  
- This database helps the chatbot quickly find the most relevant chunks when the user asks a question.

5. **User Asks a Question**  
- The user types a question about the Indian Penal Code, for example:  
  *“What is the punishment for theft?”*

6. **Retrieve Relevant Chunks**  
- The chatbot uses the vector store to find the chunks most related to the user’s question.  
- It searches for chunks whose embeddings closely match the question’s embedding.

7. **Generate the Answer Using the Language Model (Cohere)**  
- The chatbot sends the relevant chunks and the user’s question to the Cohere language model.  
- The model reads these chunks and generates a clear, concise answer based on the Indian Penal Code text.

8. **Display the Answer to the User**  
- The chatbot shows the answer to the user in a conversational format.  
- The user can then ask follow-up questions and keep chatting about the IPC.

---

### Summary:

- Load IPC text → split into small chunks → create embeddings → store embeddings in vector database →  
- User asks question → retrieve relevant chunks → send to Cohere LLM → generate and display answer → user can chat more
